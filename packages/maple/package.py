    """Maple: this software makes it possible to work on numerical quantities
(integer, real, complex) as well as with polynomials, functions, series.

Maple can derive, integrate and solve linear equation systems. It can invert
matrices and perform asymptotic expansions and resolutions of differential
equations in symbolic form. The Maple system also offers numerous functions
in numerical arithmetic and in combinatorics.

Maple is an interpreted language."""
