class Matlab(Package):
    """MATLAB (MATrix LABoratory) is a multi-paradigm numerical computing
    environment and fourth-generation programming language. A proprietary
    programming language developed by MathWorks, MATLAB allows matrix
    manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of
    algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs
    written in other languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, Fortran and Python.

    Note: MATLAB is licensed software. You will need to create an account on
    the MathWorks homepage and download MATLAB yourself. Spack will search your
    current directory for the download file. Alternatively, add this file to a
    mirror so that Spack can find it. For instructions on how to set up a
    mirror, see http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html"""
